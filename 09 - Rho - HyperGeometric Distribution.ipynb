    "## What does X count?\n",
    "\n",
    "X counts the total number (sample total) of marked individuals in the sample, without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Find probabilities in situations where you sample without replacement and you want to find the probability of getting a certain number of individuals who have a desired characteristic of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capture-Recapture Technique. This is used for estimating the Total Size of a Population when it is hidden(doesn't identify itsself) or his rare (not many individuals make up the population). Capture-Recapture is a backdoor way of making a pretty good guess at the population size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pond Example:\n",
    "1. Capture some fish, mark them (M) and release them.\n",
    "2. The next day, take another sample of fish (n) and count the number of marked fish that you \"re-capture\", (R). \n",
    "3. You can expect the number of recaptured fish (R) compared to the sample size (n) to be proportional to the number of marked fish (M) compared to the total number of fish in the pond, (N). R/n = M/N.\n",

    "## What's Fixed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sampling WITHOUT replacement.\n",
    "2. Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being sampled.\n",
    "3. You can classify the total population into two groups (sub-groups):\n",
    "    * Marked Sub-Population: individuals with the characteristics you are interested in\n",
    "    * UnMarked Sub-Population: Everyone else in the overall population\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The total number (population total) of marked individuals in the population and the total population size are fixed and known.\n",

    "## PMF\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\frac{{M \\choose x}{{N - M} \\choose {n - x}}}{N \\choose n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* N: Population size\n",
    "* n: Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "* M: marked sub-population\n",
    "* x: the number of marked individuals in the sample\n",
    "\n",
    "* n-x: the number of UNmarked individuals in the sample\n",
    "* N-M: the number of UNmarked individuals in the population\n",
    "\n",
    "You need two combinations in the numerator because you want to select x items from the marked population(M total individuals) and n-x items from the UN-marked population (N-M total individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator contains one combination, which represents the number of ways to choose a sample of size n from the poplulation N.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bounds on the values of X:\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the possible values of X?\n",
    "\n",
    "This double inequality breaks down into two boundary conditions for X that have to happen at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. max( 0, M + n - N)\n",
    "2. min( M, n)\n",

    "## Expected Value\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Variance & Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\sigma^2 = \\frac{nM}{N^2(N-1)}(N-M)(N-n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{nM}{N^2(N-1)}(N-M)(N-n)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "For sampling without replacement. Similar to the Binomial Distribution, except that you sample without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a group of 20 people, 12 men and 8 women. You randomly select five people to be on a committee, and it turns out all five people you select are men. What's the chance of that happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a formal model that leverages basic probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\frac{{12 \\choose 5}{8 \\choose 0}}{20 \\choose 5}$\n",
