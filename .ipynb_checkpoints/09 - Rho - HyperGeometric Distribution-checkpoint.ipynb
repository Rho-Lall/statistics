    "## What does X count?\n",
    "\n",
    "X counts the total number (sample total) of marked individuals in the sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What's Fixed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sampling WITHOUT replacement.\n",
    "2. Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being sampled.\n",
    "3. You can classify the total population into two groups (sub-groups):\n",
    "    * Marked Sub-Population: individuals with the characteristics you are interested in\n",
    "    * UnMarked Sub-Population: Everyone else in the overall population\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The total number (population total) of marked individuals in the population and the total population size are fixed and known.\n",

    "\n",
    "* N: Population size\n",
    "* n: Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "* M: marked sub-population\n",
    "* x: the number of marked individuals in the sample\n",
    "\n",
    "* n-x: the number of UNmarked individuals in the sample\n",
    "* N-M: the number of UNmarked individuals in the population\n",
    "\n",
    "You need two combinations in the numerator because you want to select x items from the marked population(M total individuals) and n-x items from the UN-marked population (N-M total individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator contains one combination, which represents the number of ways to choose a sample of size n from the poplulation N.\n",

    "### The Bounds on the values of X:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. max( 0, M + n - N)\n",

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "For sampling without replacement. Similar to the Binomial Distribution, except that you sample without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a group of 20 people, 12 men and 8 women. You randomly select five people to be on a committee, and it turns out all five people you select are men. What's the chance of that happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a formal model that leverages basic probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\frac{{12 \\choose 5}{8 \\choose 0}}{20 \\choose 5}$\n",
