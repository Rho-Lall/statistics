    "## What does it figure out (count)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The total # of trials needed until the $k^{th}$ success occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Fixed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions\n",
    "1. Observe a sequence of independent trials from some random process.\n",
    "2. Classify the outcomes of each trial into two groups: success or failure.\n",
    "3. Probability of success is the same for each trial.\n",
    "4. X counts the number of trials up to and including the $k^{th}$ success.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(X = x) = {\\large {{x - 1} \\choose {k - 1}} p^k {(1 - p)^{x - k}}}$\n",

    "A pattern developes in the pmf of the negative binomial as the total number of trials changes. The model peaks at the mode of the distribution and then trails off. The peaks differ, but the model is always right skewed. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Expected Value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large E(x) = \\frac{k}{p}$\n",

    ": the expected number of trials needed to obtain k successes\n",
    "* k: number of successes\n",
    "* p: probability of success\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variance & Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\sigma^2 = \\frac{k(1 -p)}{p^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\sigma = \\sqrt\\frac{k(1 - p)}{p^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a trade off between the probability of success (denominator) and the probability of failure (numerator)\n",
    "* If the value of p is close to one, expect plenty of success right away, and close together\n",
    "* If the value of p is close to zero, there is an increase in V(X) as expected successes happen much later\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "People in quality control often use the negative binomial to determine if the manufacturing process is going according to specifications. They can keep sampling items until they reach the fourth defective one and count how many items they sample until it happens. If it take a long time to reach the occurance, that's good news, they would conclude the process is \"in control\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If they get to four right away, that's bad news, and the manager would conclude the process is \"out of control\".\n",
